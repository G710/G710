You have an awesome recipe? Tell your friends!

## What is it?

There are a lot of sites online that have awesome recipes. But wouldn't it be cool to see and try the recipes your friends made? That's why I created this web application for me and my friends. The webpage is optimized for mobile viewing but can also be accessed from desktop.

It also provides basic social interaction like following users and liking recipes.

The app was created with the web framework [Ruby On Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/). If you are interested in hosting it yourself you can write me a pm over at github.

## Android app

To give the user an easy access to the webinterface he can download an app. It's basically a webview but enhaces the user experience with offline pages and shopping checklists.
